Quick and dirty howto:

1 - install arduino, tested with 1.6.12

2 - downgrade avr boards to version 1.6.11
    follow: https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=419445.0

3 - Install Sanguino firmware 
    follow: http://dustsreprap.blogspot.pt/2015/06/better-way-to-install-sanguino-in.html

Open up the menu   File|Preferences 

At the bottom is a field  Additional Boards manager URLs:
Enter "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lauszus/Sanguino/master/package_lauszus_sanguino_index.json"

4 - Add to the boards.txt the config about anet

On my linux is in:

~/.arduino15/packages/Sanguino/hardware/avr/1.0.1/boards.txt

On my Mac is in:

~/Library/Arduino15/packages/Sanguino/hardware/avr/1.0.1/boards.txt

hi guys and thankyou for downloading SkyNet3d v1.1 Alfa Firmware

as i have recieved quite a bit of feedback now on version 1.0 alfa i have tried to address as many issues as possible in this release
however alot of people seem to have different hardware to me and ive found it difficult to offer sound advice when they choose my firmware
due to this i have now set up a facebook page and a paypal donate option.. the firmware is free to all but if any of you feel the need to
donate i will be forever grateful and this project will be able to prosper much further and onto other platforms.

https://www.facebook.com/skynet3ddevelopment/?view_public_for=1757193471188905

there is a donate button located in the "apps" section on the page
also dont forget to "like" while your at it


so .. what will i use ''your'' money for?    well first of all i would like to buy more hardware such as the ramps 1.4 kit. ive had alot of people
asking to get my firmware on this board and i simply cannot provide it until i can test it myself. then once i have a ramps 1.4 kit i will move onto whatever
you guys want me to ... if you want the anet v2.0 board and i have the funds for it .. then i will buy one and release Skynet3d for that too.
also some of your money will go towards filament as i use quite a bit in my testing phase
i will also be on hand to provide as much support and guidance as one man can.

i want to make SkyNet 3d "THE" Go-To Easy to install+ setup Firmware for all these chinese printers and with your help i hope to make this happen
i keep saying it but in the short time ive been in this community. ive never felt more welcome.. so Skynet3d is my way of giving a little bit back :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 please note.. if 'you' kill your printer.. then let it be known that ''YOU'' killed it .. not me :)

ive never released anything before so i appologise if things are sloppy in the tutorial but ill try and get all steps in the correct order
follow these instructions and you should end up with a working SkyNet3D (marlin) firmware with 9 point autobed leveling

i must have a slightly warped bed on my printer because for some reason the repetier firmware with its 3 point leveling would only work for
small parts located in the center of the bed.. i tried adjusting the firmware to allow for grid bed leveling but couldnt get it to use the
co ordinates i had set.. marlin works for me so im happy and hopefully itll work for you too..
i printed the same large part which spans the whole bed on repetier and on SkyNet3d V1 and on repetier well.. it didnt work.. i had my nozzle
gouge out scratches on both sides of the bed... i switched over to this and printed the same part with the same offset settings and it just worked
 so like i said.. im very happy ..

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changelog;
V1.0 - this was the first version
v1.1- updated to adress the issues with prints being off from the center.. it seems to print bang on in the center now so happy days

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

watch this video then watch this video again :)

by now you should already have the sensor wired up correctly and be ready to install the firmware.
pause the video when tom shows the wiring diagram and then wire up your connector if it needs it (depending on sensor)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to install firmware

####### 1. unzip all files
####### 2. open arduino 1.6.3
####### Original instructions 1 & 2 can be substituted by the steps at the beginning of this document
#######

3. go to 'Tools' then 'Board' and make sure 'Anet v1.0 is selected
4. underneath 'Board' go to 'port' and set the required com port for your printer -eg. COM4
5. click File -Open - and navigate to the SkyNet3D_V1.1alfa folder and open SkyNet3D_V1.1alfa.ino
6.click upload and wait..
7. when your printer reads SkyNet3D on the screen your done and it is installed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we will now set up the offset because once the printer homes to z - the nozzle wont be close enough to the bed!
i use cura 15.06.4 for this.

1.so install that. go to preferences and set print window to pronterface ui
	set up your machine settings and make sure the com port and baudrate match your printer
2.load up any stl model and hit print... we wont actually be printing right now so dont worry too much here about the settings
3.manually control with the buttons in the print window so that the nozzle is just touching the build plate
4. adjust your sensor so that it is about 1mm above the build surface when the nozzle just touches
5. raise z by 10 (tool up button)
6.press the white 'home' button
7. slide a piece of paper underneath you nozzle
8. type G92 Z10 and hit enter- to check this command has worked type M114 and you should get a line similar to  this with Z:10.000

 	(X:131.00 Y:153.00 Z:10.00 E:0.00 Count X: 131.00 Y:153.00 Z:10.00)

9. lower the nozzle using the 0.1down button until theres a little bit of friction on the paper (like you would if your were leveling normally)
10. type M114 and you should get a line like this where z is lower than 10.000

	(X:131.00 Y:153.00 Z:8.90 E:0.00 Count X: 131.00 Y:153.00 Z:8.90)

you see mine is  "Z:8.90"

11. get your scientific calculator out and punch in the numbers 10-Z (z being the number you just got from lowering the nozzle)
12. that is your offset... or damn near close.. you can adjust it finer by playing about .. but thats pretty much it...

mine was 1.1.. add a minus and a couple of m's and you get -1.1mm << that is your offset for the next part
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
now we will reconfigure the firmware to have the correct offset value

1. open arduino
2. click File -Open - and navigate to the SkyNet3D_V1.1alfa folder and open SkyNet3D_V1.1alfa.ino
3. go to the 'configuration.h' tab
4. hit ctrl+f and copy this line below into find

#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 		0//-12.35

5.change the 'zero' so it reads your offset figure (-1.1mm)

#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 		-1.1//-12.35

6.click upload and wait..
7. when your printer reads SkyNet3D on the screen your done and it is installed...again.. only with the offset being correct this time :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

now just add a G29 after the G28 in your start g-code and fannys your aunt..

take a break .. roll a phat one--oops  make a cup of tea and pat yourself on the back..

enjoy 9 point autoleveling and marlin on the anet a8

if you get any problems uploading the firmware or communicating with the printer
 make sure no other programs are connected to it like i just did while writing this tutorial

also if after all that you are still not getting it to work
try installing repetier host and loading nicks eeprom settings from the repetier firmware in the filesection (included in this package too)

thanks to everyone on the group who has helped me get printing!


ive been scou and i hope this has been easy to follow.. happy printing :)
